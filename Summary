My small report 

I have analyzed businesses located in Toronto area with the goal of 
opening a restaurant in a place with the least amount of dining options. 

The data used all comes from Foursquare database, which allows to query data for free for developers. 

The Methodology applied relies on categorizing local businesses restricted to some location.  
After categorizing I calculate the frequency at which different businesses appear 
on the map of Toronto and choose the most popular businesses for each district.

As a result I found a district in which there are almost no dining options, 
which with my humble knowledge of business development 
I estimate to be the best option to opening a small restaurant with the highest chance of attracting customers. 

As a conclusion: by completing the courses on data science I realized 
what kind of powerful tool it is and got an impression on how to use it. 

It was a great opportunity!
